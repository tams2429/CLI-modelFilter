## Overview 👓

The **goals** of this challenge was to **build** a **simple, command line application** that allows user to **filter through** a **JSON object data** by **'location'** and **returns** the **associated 'models'**.

This was written in **JavaScript** as this is the language I am **most comfortable** in.

## Technologies 💻

- General:
    - **JavaScript**
    - **Jest**
- Others:
    - **GitHub**

## Process 📝
- I started by **analysing** what the **requirements of the task** was (i.e. **return the 'models'** that **match** the **'location'** the user wants to filter for)

- Next, I **planned** out the **individual steps/logic** required to **return** the **required output**

- Along the way, I used **console logs** to help **debug any errors** against expected outputs

### MVP
- **GitHub repository** containing **project code**
- **Readme document** containing **thought processes** and **any assumptions made**
- **Automated tests** as necessary
- A **simple**, **command line application** that allows users to **filter** through a **JSON Object Data by 'location'** and **returns** the **associated 'models'**

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

If you wish to **run it locally**, you will need to **follow the steps below**:

- **Fork** or **Clone** the **GitHub repository** ([https://github.com/tams2429/CLI-modelFilter](https://github.com/tams2429/CLI-modelFilter)),
- In the root project folder, run `npm install` to **install** all **dependencies**,
- `npm test` to **run all the Jest Tests** for the **whole application**,
- `node modelFilter.js` to **run** the **function**,

## Future Work ☕
### Tests
- I have tried to implement a **simple test** using **Jest** which is **based** on the **provided input** and **output**,
- Given more experience and time on this, I would try to find more **'edge' cases** (i.e. **malformed data**) and implement those tests,
